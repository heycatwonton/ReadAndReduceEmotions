How Algorithms Read and Reduce Emotion: Interrogating Misclassification in Affective Computing

This project examines how modern NLP models recognize and abbreviate emotion. Given the human-annotated GoEmotions dataset, we compare results of a number of classifiers (e.g., Google's GoEmotions model, VADER, TextBlob) on the same richly emotional texts. We aim to find out what emotional signals can be decoded by algorithms, where misclassifications occur, and how models short-circuit complex human affect into discrete categories. By linguistic examination and classification errors, we uncover the affective computing presumptions that get flattened, erased, or blown up. Our research includes a critical perspective, asking: what machines see of our emotions, and what they could possibly overlook? More than model performance, we challenge the emotion as a fixed, classifiable phenomenon. With a six-week timeframe, we will analyze a targeted sample (300â€“500 cases) to ensure computational and qualitative balance.
